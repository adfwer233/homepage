I'm **Bao Anchang**, PhD Student in [School of software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research interests include geometry processing, computer-aided design (CAD), and computer graphics. Specifically, my current projects involve developing robust geometric computations for CAD systems and exploring Monte Carlo techniques for solving partial differential equations.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Software Engineering from [School of software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), complemented by a minor in Pure and Applied Mathematics from [Department of Mathematical Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
